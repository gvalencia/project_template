## General Introduction

Several rounds of Quantitative Easing by the Federal Reserve and other measures by its European counterparts started a competition of who is able to depreciate more its currency. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has been accused of "unfair" devaluation of the Yen. Claimed as an act of war by most developing countries such as Brazil and China, and as an act of supreme responsibility towards the global economy by President Obama ("what is good for us is good for the world"), we are still unable to understand the implications of this movement in the world.
Questions like the following, and much others, can be easily formulated:
What are there long-term risks of the currency war?
A similar movement of currency war has occurred before, in the 30s. Our extensively more connected world can change its effects?
Are we living in mercantilism 2.0?



## The Model

There are two trading blocks Developed Markets(DM) and Emerging Markets (EM). Developed markets need to stimulate their economies using a monetary stimulus (QE) because they are facing a recession. They also have a flexible exchange rate so the stimulus is translated in a temporal decrease of the interest rates. Under this scenario investors will prefer to invest in EM than in DM. This preference causes net capital outflows that will be translated in weaker currency.
The DM weaker currency will boost their exports incresing the GDP in this block. This assume that both DM and EM have flexible exchange rates and the logic is based in the Mundell Fleming model that is the main stream framework to describe relationships between the money market, the goods market and the central bank balance of payments. 

In reality that is not true and some EM in particular china have a fixed exchange rate. So, the only focus of the central bank is to ensure that the currency is fluctuating in very small band.
When there are capital inflows , the EM currecy will have a lot of preassure making the EM central bank to increases the amount of foreign reserves. This also is equivalent to increse the money supply, creating an scenario with higher short term growth.

So in conclusion the increase in the monetary suplly in the DM will not boost the economies is there is not flexible exchange rate. 
There are  risk associated with this expansion in the monetary. The punishment associated to this strategy is inflation or the formation asset bubbles.



We present two different models. The first one is the standard iterated prisoner dilemma (IPD). The second is a multigame model. The IPD, shows when countries use “Tit for Tat” strategies will create trading blocks, where emerging markets (CURRENCY CONTROLLERS) grow more than developed markets. (PRINTERS). The iterated prisoner dilemma is a first approach with many unrealistic assumptions. 
For example, that every couple of countries is facing a prisoner dilemma. Why to be restricted to a prisoner dilemma payoff schema? It also assumes that every pair of countries has the same military or political power.  Finally, it does not give any insight in terms of policies design or how to connect the model with the empirical data. 
The initial point of the second model is the existence of economical blocks with antagonical interests. 

This model is based on the paper Cooperation, Wars and Revolution by Helbing and Johansson. We assume the existence of two set of countries with two opposite interest or preferences. As we mention before we are interested in modelling developed markets and emerging markets trade. In particular, today what developed markets consider like a free trade policy is not for emerging markets and vice versa.  Block’s size grows according to the standard equation of dynamical replicators. 
In this model countries could interact inside the same block or with countries of other blocks. 
We assume symmetrical 2X2 matrix allowing countries to face 4 different games: Prisoner Dilemma, Harmonic game, Hawk –Dove game, and Stag Hunt game. Three control parameters are introduced: Coordination, Trust and Power. Coordination and trust determine the games payoff matrix and power captures the GDP differences or military power differences.





## Fundamental Questions

- Why trading blocks emerges?
- What are the possible equibria in the international trade between two blocks?
- How will win the currency wars?
- How to design policies to prevent a currency war?
- How currency wars affects the size of the firm?
- In a currency war situations industries  become more concentrated than in other states?
- Are state capitalism and  transnacional companies  corrrelated with a currency war scenario?



## Expected Results

-  Emergence of coallision between countries
-  Suboptimal solutions for the world trade
-  Different possible regime between blocks with antagonical interests
-  High concentration between  internal countries industries , formation of oligopolies.
-  Low level of efficiency in the supply chain and overcapacity.
