## General Introduction

Several rounds of Quantitative Easing by the Federal Reserve and other measures by its European counterparts started a competition of who is able to depreciate more its currency. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has been accused of "unfair" devaluation of the Yen. Claimed as an act of war by most developing countries such as Brazil and China, and as an act of supreme responsibility towards the global economy by President Obama ("what is good for us is good for the world"), we are still unable to understand the implications of this movement in the world.
Questions like the following, and much others, can be easily formulated:
What are there long-term risks of the currency war?
A similar movement of currency war has occurred before, in the 30s. Our extensively more connected world can change its effects?
Are we living in mercantilism 2.0?
If Adam smith were alive in XXI century he would be surprised that the wealth of nations in the XXI century resembles more a mercantilism model and his free markets ideal. Currency wars reflects the tension in the factors of production in the world economy, and the intense competence to control one of the factor of production in the absence of a new disruptive technology.
China and India control the labor supply. US and Europe and Japan control the capital supply and Middle East, Russia and Brazil control of natural resources supply.



## The Model

Disruptive innovations generate a change of scale in the world productivity. Due to the innovation lock-in effect pioneers got a natural monopoly. The monopolistic structure is not efficient when there is a codificable understanding of this innovation, cooperation is needed and democratizing the knowledge are necessary to spread the innovation potential in the across the society.
Transaction cost theory is possible claims that exist 3 governance systems depending of uncertainty level: Efficient Markets, Networks and Hierarchy. I will add other state called crowd, it is an state of infinite hierarchy that happens when market faces situations of ambiguity this market state is characterized population is extremity homogenous action between agents and the decision making process is based only in confidence.
The thesis of this project is that companies are adaptative organizational arrays whose is aim is to capture value while they minimize their transaction costs

The two most important variables are: Homogenity (Heterogenity) and Information (Confidence). The idea is to use macro-economical as proxy to confidence, make sese to realted the level of credit in a economy with confidence.
As proxy to homegenity is possible to use the correlation between stocks and different financial asset classes.

At the same time I plan to use game theory and multi-agent systems to model the currency wars?


## Fundamental Questions

- Is there empiral evidence of market, networks ,hierachy  and crowd in the financial markets?
-	Is the state capitalism and cooperatism an optimal structure when the knowledge is ambigous.?
- What of the 4 governance structure are the most fragile?
-	To model currency wars using multi-agent systems and game theory
-	Who will win the war between corporations and state capitalism in multi-agent system?



## Expected Results

- Bubbles and jumps in volatililty could used as proxy to indentify state transitions.
- The termal path is a methodology shows changes lead-lag relationships between macro-economical varibales.
- Currency wars has a not efficient outcome but with the game repetition and less ambiguity agents will make transitions between Imitation, Cooperation and Competition
